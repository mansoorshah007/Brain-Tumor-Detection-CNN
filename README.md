# Brain Tumor Detection Project

This project aims to detect brain tumors using a custom model. It includes a web-based front end built with Streamlit for user interaction and visualization.

## Components

### 1. Front End (Front end/bratapp.py)

The `bratapp.py` file contains the Streamlit application for the front end. Users can interact with the brain tumor detection model through this web-based interface.

### 2. Model (Model/custom-model.h5)

The `custom-model.h5` file represents the pre-trained custom model for brain tumor detection. This model is used in the Streamlit app for making predictions.

### 3. Notebook (Notebook/brain-tumor-detection.ipynb)

The `brain-tumor-detection.ipynb` notebook is where the brain tumor detection model was developed and trained. It may include code, visualizations, and explanations related to the model creation process.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app for the front end:

   ```bash
   streamlit run "Front end/bratapp.py"
   ```

3. Access the app in your browser at the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501).

## Note

- The `requirements.txt` file lists the project dependencies. Make sure to install them before running the Streamlit app.
